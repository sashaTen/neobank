Let me know if you need any more details or a deeper explanation on any specific component

3 web development concepts, proficiency in Django framework including models, views, templates, and forms,
 familiarity with databases and SQL, and knowledge of version control systems like Git.

4 Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
Model − The lowest level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data.

View − This is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.

Controller − Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View

user => uls =>  view => models/templates...


5..so  later   go  for  this   :

  and  then   apply   one   by  one   the   concepts 

...https://stockanalysis.com/  .. this is  very  good   site as   the  example  
compare it to   yahoo  finance   and the n   maybe   you   ll have  ideas . also do it yourself .

Version control − This involves tracking changes to code, data, and models using tools like Git to ensure reproducibility and maintain a history of all changes.

Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) − This involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying machine learning models using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

Containerization − This involves packaging machine learning models and dependencies into containers using tools like Docker or Kubernetes, which enables easy deployment and scaling of models in production environments.

Model serving − This involves setting up a server to host machine learning models and serving predictions on incoming data.

Monitoring and logging − This involves tracking the performance of machine learning models in production environments using tools like Prometheus or Grafana, and logging errors and alerts to enable proactive maintenance.

Automated testing − This involves automating the testing of machine learning models to ensure they are accurate and robust.
