1 managing databases, routing URLs, handling user input through forms, and managing user authentication.
2 Django Components

MVT Architecture: Models for data, Views for business logic, Templates for presentation.
URLconf: Connects URLs to Views.
Admin Interface: Provides an auto-generated admin panel.
Middleware: Functions for request/response processing.
Settings & Static Files: Configurations and asset management.
Security & Testing: Built-in tools for security and quality assurance.
Let me know if you need any more details or a deeper explanation on any specific component

3 web development concepts, proficiency in Django framework including models, views, templates, and forms,
 familiarity with databases and SQL, and knowledge of version control systems like Git.

4 Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
Model − The lowest level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data.

View − This is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.

Controller − Software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View

user => uls =>  view => models/templates...


5..so  later   go  for  this   :
