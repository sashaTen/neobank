mlflow  is  for  each  stage  but  i  
only saw the  experrementation with   not  clear  idea  yet 

so the components of  mlflow are : 
a.  ui 
b.  Evaluation
c.  mlops 
d.  tracking
f.  deployment
j. regisrty

below  is the guide simple   intro so  try to replicate  it   
https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/intro-quickstart/index.html

GenAI and MLflow
is  also   next    big  step  to  go .


so   mlflow  is for :  develop deploy  ,  manage 
...tracking  gives ui and api  for code versions , params , metrics ,  articfacts , it has all details that we  need  in 
order to track all details 
... model registry  : model  evolution and full  cycle  managememt  lineage, versioning, aliasing, tagging, and annotations.

...llms management

why   use   it   ???????
* exprerement  track 
* reproduction   which  include  info  of  env  and more for scalable and collaborative work
* deploymenet consistency : too many tools  and no one standart way  so mlflloow helps with consistency
* model managememt : in  productions the number of expremtns  is   very  big  so good  management
* library  agnostic 

so  basically   : 
1 trace evolutions of model  with tracking sevrer 
2 consistency
3 compatable  with many  languages  and tools 


how to  use ?????
1 with   mlflow ui   you  track  and choose  the  best 
2  registred  models can  be monitored  with mlflow ui 




below  is    very   good   source  to   learn  from   :

this  is  like   basics  of   mlflow   
so  after   learninig   them   go and  learn   another tool  for   mlops:

pip   vs  conda :  conda  is  env  for  many  other   non  python  libraoires   
like  react  for  example  and the   pip  is   for   pure python  packages
