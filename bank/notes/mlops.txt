First of all you  dont have to learn  every single topic in mlops. Only basics.



Basically   the   big   picture  of  project  looks  like   : 

Model training 
Deployment of api of  django 
Monitoring and logging 
CI  / CD   

Tools : 
Django 
Sklearn / keras or  any 
Docker
Github actions 
Mlflow 
Grafana 

Mloops   is   way too big   so   that is why  just  build project above and then improve on  top of it using  the books  and try to see the big  picture and use proper tools because tools are just tools .   And tools  must be used properly. 



https://mlops-for-all.github.io/en/    this is   very good  site  for learning mlpops 



1 register  on the   databricks community edition site  
and start there new exprement
2 !pip install mlflow
!databricks configure --host https://community.cloud.databricks.com/
run this and register with  email  and the password  
3 refresh  page 
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("")
mlflow.set_experiment("your  experemnt name") copied from the databricks site
4 then train and test data  
5 start , load   , eval  with   model paramters  
6 end run 



................end to end mlops project : 


below   is    mlops project setup guide so  just  finish 
every step  and thats it :

Tools and Technologies
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Data Versioning: DVC (Data Version Control)
Experiment Tracking: MLflow
Model Training: Scikit-learn (or TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Containerization: Docker
Model Serving: FastAPI
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana


.....DOCKER   : 
*it is way to package  the  software to run  on   any  software
* 3 musts :   dockerfile   /  image /  container . .


python -m venv myenv
myenv/Scripts/activate
pip  installations 
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Dockerfile : 
FROM python:3.11
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV  PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
WORKDIR  / app

COPY  requirements.txt .
RUN pip  install --upgrade pip 
RUN pip  install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["python" ,  "manage.py"  ,  "runserver" , "0.0.0.0:8000"]

.dockerignore : 
.env
myenv/
Dockerfile


in bash :  
docker build -t my-docker-img
docker run -d --name my-docker-container -p 8001:8000 my-docker-img

then   you can   delete  your  container  and create using  compose file : 
docker-compose.yml:
name  :  my-docker-project
services :
    app:
      image: my-docker-img 
      container_name: my-docker-container 
      ports : 
         - "8001:8000"
         

docker compose up -d 
then  stop  it   if  needed 




zenml   is  pretty  easy    just donwnload   with   venv 
then  build  with   steps and  pipeline
in bash zenml up   --blocking  and   look at  gui api  the process of   pipeline.
