First of all you  dont have to learn  every single topic in mlops. Only basics.



Basically   the   big   picture  of  project  looks  like   : 
Model training 
Deployment of api of  django 
Monitoring and logging 
CI  / CD   

Tools : 
Django 
Sklearn / keras or  any 
Docker
Github actions 
Mlflow 
Grafana 

Mloops   is   way too big   so   that is why  just  build project above and then improve on  top of it using  the books  and try to see the big  picture and use proper tools because tools are just tools .   And tools  must be used properly. 



https://mlops-for-all.github.io/en/    this is   very good  site  for learning mlpops 



1 register  on the   databricks community edition site  
and start there new exprement
2 !pip install mlflow
!databricks configure --host https://community.cloud.databricks.com/
run this and register with  email  and the password  
3 refresh  page 
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("")
mlflow.set_experiment("your  experemnt name") copied from the databricks site
4 then train and test data  
5 start , load   , eval  with   model paramters  
6 end run 



................end to end mlops project :
