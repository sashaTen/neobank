https://javascript.plainenglish.io/essential-database-concepts-for-backend-development-from-design-to-development-4474a46d426b

learn from those two .. larn concepts and ask  jpt to adapt to mini practice. 
...
the database design example  is when you  build the conncetions 
like the sale has time , id of products in sale and the products also have the 
id's of who inveneted maybe region of development . employee may have the department id in it .  
the relationships vary from one to  one like account and profile as well one to many 
like one sale may have many products in it and many to many like 
items and clients.
...
integrities are important like refer must be valid and primary key has to  be  unique and no null
...
primary key is id of row
....
one to many : 
   primary key 
   no  references 
parent table :()
   child table: foreign key (...) references (primary key of parent)



many to  many   : 
you create  association   table like 
transaction which has  both id's of two tables.
